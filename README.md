Application based on:   
◦ Storage - abstract class with abstractmethods and base logic   
◦ Store - class inherited from Storage responsible for store logic and parameters   
◦ Shop - class inherited from Storage responsible for shop logic and parameters   
◦ Request - class responsible for user request and its processing   
◦ App - class responsible for application logic. Takes user request and works with Store and Shop classes

## How it works:   
1. When you start application, you get invite to make a request of movement some items from one position to another.   
2. You need to write request such as 'Доставить 3 коробки из склад в магазин'.   
3. When the processing of application finished, you will get the result of movement items and offer to make another request.
